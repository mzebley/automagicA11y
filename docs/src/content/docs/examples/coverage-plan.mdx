# Examples roadmap

This roadmap inventories the examples we already ship and the scenarios we still need to capture. Use it to coordinate contributions and avoid duplicate work.

## Core primitives

- [ ] **Attributes + Classes sandbox** – Inspect how `ensureId`, `appendToken`, and truthiness-driven class hooks behave on arbitrary markup.
- [ ] **Context capability lab** – Toggle each capability (focus trap, inert siblings, hover intent) to demonstrate the helpers exported from `@core/context/helpers`.
- [ ] **Placement visualizer** – Drag a trigger around the viewport and watch how `resolveAnchoredPlacement` chooses the best side.

## Patterns

### Toggle

- [x] Basic show/hide playground (existing page).
- [ ] Grouped accordions using `data-automagica11y-group`.
- [ ] Toggle + menu context once behaviors ship for menus.

### Dialog

- [x] Context vs alias parity (existing page).
- [ ] Dialog integrated with `initFocusInitial` and the animate plugin.
- [ ] Multi-trigger dialog demonstrating inert sibling coordination.

### Popover

- [x] Dismiss-on-outside-click demo (existing page).
- [ ] Command palette with focus map ordering and search field.
- [ ] Teaching bubble that responds to `automagica11y:popover:placement` updates.

### Tooltip

- [x] Context vs alias parity (existing page).
- [ ] Hover intent playground for open/close delay tuning.
- [ ] Mobile long-press tooltip with explicit dismiss controls.

## Focus helpers

- [ ] Live editor for `data-automagica11y-focus-map` selectors.
- [ ] Dialog integration that shows how focus is restored when closing.

## Plugins

### Announce

- [ ] Screen reader announcement inspector that logs polite/assertive output.

### Animate

- [ ] Trigger vs target animation comparison.
- [ ] Selector-based animation watching an overlay element.
- [ ] Integration with focus helpers to delay focus restoration until close completes.

Track overall progress on the [Core modules reference](/reference/core/) and individual pattern pages for context-specific coverage notes.
