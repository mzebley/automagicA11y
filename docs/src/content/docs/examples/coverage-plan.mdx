# Examples roadmap

This roadmap inventories the examples we already ship and the scenarios we still need to capture. Use it to coordinate contributions and avoid duplicate work.

## Core primitives

- [x] **Truthiness alias inspector** – Demonstrates how synonymous state keywords map to the same class hooks (existing page).
- [ ] **Attributes + Classes sandbox** – Inspect how `ensureId`, `appendToken`, and truthiness-driven class hooks behave on arbitrary markup.
- [ ] **Context capability lab** – Toggle each capability (focus trap, inert siblings, hover intent, anchor follow) to demonstrate the helpers exported from `@core/context/helpers`.
- [ ] **Context mode explorer** – Compare `all`, `semantics-only`, and `behaviors-only` toggles across dialog and tooltip contexts.
- [ ] **Placement visualizer** – Drag a trigger around the viewport and watch how `resolveAnchoredPlacement` chooses the best side.

## Patterns

### Toggle

- [x] Basic show/hide playground (existing page).
- [x] Truthiness alias synonyms wired to the same state (existing page).
- [x] Grouped accordions using `data-automagica11y-group` (new example).
- [ ] Multi-target toggle controlling companion overlays and ARIA mirrors.
- [ ] Toggle + menu context once behaviors ship for menus.

### Dialog

- [x] Context vs alias parity (existing page).
- [ ] Backdrop dismissal toggled with `data-automagica11y-dialog-dismissable`.
- [ ] Dialog integrated with `initFocusInitial` and the animate plugin.
- [ ] Multi-trigger dialog demonstrating inert sibling coordination.

### Popover

- [x] Dismiss-on-outside-click demo (existing page).
- [ ] Command palette with focus map ordering and search field.
- [ ] Teaching bubble that responds to `automagica11y:popover:placement` updates.
- [ ] Sticky popover example showing `data-automagica11y-popover-outside-dismiss="false"` and scroll thresholds.

### Tooltip

- [x] Context vs alias parity (existing page).
- [ ] Hover intent playground for open/close delay tuning.
- [ ] Mobile long-press tooltip with explicit dismiss controls.
- [ ] Tooltip dismiss button recipe using `data-automagica11y-tooltip-dismiss`.

### Future contexts

- [ ] Menu semantics gallery showing `role="menu"` markup before interactive behaviors ship.
- [ ] Disclosure/accordion context parity demo once shared behaviors land.
- [ ] Listbox, tablist, and tree context previews illustrating the automatic role scaffolding.

## Focus helpers

- [x] Focus map ordering demo (existing page).
- [x] Per-element focus links chaining `data-automagica11y-focus-next`/`-prev` (existing page).
- [ ] Focus trap auto-activation walkthrough with `data-automagica11y-focus-trap` options.
- [ ] Focus initial + animate plugin handshake so focus waits until exit transitions finish.
- [ ] Live editor for `data-automagica11y-focus-map` selectors.
- [ ] Dialog integration that shows how focus is restored when closing.

## Plugins

### Announce

- [ ] Screen reader announcement inspector that logs polite/assertive output.
- [ ] Grouped toggle announcements showing only the newly opened item speaks.
- [ ] Localization walkthrough for author-supplied announcement strings.

### Animate

- [ ] Trigger vs target animation comparison.
- [ ] Selector-based animation watching an overlay element.
- [ ] Integration with focus helpers to delay focus restoration until close completes.

Track overall progress on the [Core modules reference](/reference/core/) and individual pattern pages for context-specific coverage notes.
