  tagline: From declaration to interaction, <em>automagically</em>. One attribute handles ARIA, focus flow, and visual state management so you can ship accessible code without the boilerplate.

## Try it out

<Playground id="landing-toggle" heading="The 5-second toggle" description="One attribute, full accessibility." >
  <div slot="demo">
    <button
      data-automagica11y-toggle="#landing-toggle-panel"
      class="sl-link-button not-content primary"
    >Toggle me, friend.</button>
    <div id="landing-toggle-panel" class="docs-cta-panel">
      Automagica11y synchronizes <code>aria-expanded</code>, handles keyboard input, and keeps the DOM tidy.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div slot="code">
{`
<button data-automagica11y-toggle="#landing-toggle-panel">
  Toggle me, friend.
</button>
<div id="landing-toggle-panel">
  Automagica11y synchronizes <code>aria-expanded</code>, handles keyboard input, and keeps the DOM tidy.
</div>
`}
  </div>
</Playground>


We didn't just toggle [hidden] there either. Automagica11y took that bare bones HTML and also gave it ids, aria-controls, aria-expanded, aria-labelled-by, <em>and</em> aria-hidden. All with a single data-attribute.
