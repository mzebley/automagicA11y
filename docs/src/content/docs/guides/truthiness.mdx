# Truthiness

Truthiness keeps class hooks, events, and plugins consistent across patterns. Instead of remembering exact keywords, you can author whatever feels natural and automagicA11y will map it to the canonical state.

> 💡 **Prefix aliases supported:** Every example that uses `data-automagica11y-*` also works with shorthand prefixes like `data-automagically-*`, `data-ama11y-*`, or `data-automagic-*`. The runtime normalizes these aliases before truthiness parsing.

## Canonical states

| Truthy (open) | Falsy (closed) |
|---------------|----------------|
| `open` | `closed` |
| `expanded` | `collapsed` |
| `shown` | `hidden` |
| `active` | `inactive` |
| `pressed` | `unpressed` |
| `true` | `false` |
| `on` | `off` |

Use these tokens after `data-automagica11y-trigger-class-*` or `data-automagica11y-target-class-*` and the library will resolve them to the correct boolean.

## Aliases in action

```html
<button
  data-automagica11y-toggle="#faq"
  data-automagica11y-trigger-class-expanded="btn--primary"
  data-automagica11y-trigger-class-collapsed="btn--ghost"
>
  FAQ
</button>
```

The trigger receives `btn--primary` whenever the toggle is open, regardless of whether the synonym is `expanded`, `shown`, or `true`.

## Why it matters

- **Design tokens stay readable.** Use `active` or `hidden` if that’s how your team speaks.
- **Plugins stay simple.** Lifecycle hooks emit a boolean, so you never translate states manually.
- **Contexts stay compatible.** Dialogs, tooltips, and future patterns all share the same mapping.

  <p>You can extend truthiness with the context alias system or by registering custom plugins that normalize your own vocabulary before it reaches the registry.</p>
