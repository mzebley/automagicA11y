# Branding & Voice

automagicA11y represents accessibility made *effortless* and *predictable*.

---

## Taglines

- "Drop an attribute. Get the ARIA."
- "Accessibility by declaration."

## Tone

Friendly, practical, and developer-first. Avoid heavy jargon or corporate-speak. Use plain language with light humor when appropriate.

## Visual Identity (future)

- Color theme: calm accessibility blues and neutral backgrounds.
- Logo concept: an attribute tag `<a11y>` morphing into a toggle icon.
